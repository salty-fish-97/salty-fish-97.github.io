<h3>About</h3>
<p>My name is Yu Shen, currently a 4th-year PhD student in School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by <a href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/index.html">Prof. Bin Cui</a>.
  My research interests are Black-Box and AutoML systems, algorithms and applications.
  Before that, I obtained the B.S. degree in School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University at 2019.
</p>

<p>Motivated by industrial requirements, I have published 16 papers in top DB and ML conferences, among which PaSca achieves the Best Student Award üèÜ in WWW 22.
  In addition, I'm the core designer and contributor of <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/mindware">MindWare</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box">OpenBox</a>, among which OpenBox achieves the Top prize üèÜ in the open-source innovation competition at 2021 CCF ChinaSoft conference.
  Those projects have already been applied in corporations (Tencent, ByteDance, etc.) and achieved significant improvements in real production.
